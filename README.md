# Remote-Control
A script to go into a server anonymously and execute commands. 

REMOTE CONTROL PROJECT 

Requirements:
1.	Install the relevant applications
2.	Check if the connection to the vps is anonymous 
3.	Connect to a VPS and execute scans 
a.	Option 1 - interactive, ask user for inputs 
b.	Option 2 - use arguments $1 $2 
c.	Option 3 - Inside the script 
d.	VPS - digital ocean, aws, Ubuntu, kali 
i.	https://m.do.co/c/2099826f2433 
ii.	You can create a new droplet (server), Access > Launch Droplet Console 
4.	 Use comments in your code to explain your actions
5.	If you are using code from the internet, add credit and links
6.	Document your code and steps , proving that the functions work 



My kali – 172.16.*.*
My vps – 159.223.*.*

I am showing you ssh BEFORE running script. Nipe is disabled and connection is established from Kali with original ip address to vps. 

Exit and run Script. 

 


My script has a total of 6 Steps. I will give you a breakdown on the step-by-step as we go. 

Run script. 




Step 1. 
I am calling my script, NRproject.sh located in /home/hairkal/scripting. 
So I will be running my script in the scripting folder. 
The 1st function is called ‘iam’. It shows usersname and original ip before proceeding into going anonymous. 

 


Step 2.
After establishing the user, the script will then proceed to activate nipe. My nipe is located in /home/hairkal/nipe. 
Therefore, I will need to specify the location in the script and activated nipe. 
I also added on the variable $active to be echoed to user. So that user is being prompt that nipe is activated. 

 

Step 3 & 4.
We now know that nipe is activated. But just to be sure , I have added in our anonymous checker using if conditions exercise that we previously did into use. 
I added the variable $anon which calls out our ‘random/anonymous’ ip to our user to confirm that we are indeed anonymous and echo new anonymous ip location

 


Step 5 & 6
I will now be going into ssh after confirming that I am indeed anonymous.  This function allows me to access the vps and proves that you are able to login as root for the remote server by using the whoami command.. And once I am in, it will run the case options continuously without interruption  (ssh -T) 

*I also made use of my private and public key to authenticate my login without prompting password. 

ssh – provides a default pseudo terminal / needs user interaction 
ssh -t – Force pseudo-terminal allocation.  This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote machine, which can be very seful, e.g. when implementing menu services.  Multiple -t options force tty allocation, even if ssh has no local tty.
ssh -T – Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.
 
So, I tried multiple variations into how this could work. 

First solution:
1.	Creating a script in the vps and run it on the vps itself. It works   
2.	The script is now stored in the vps. So I tried calling the script and running it from my host terminal. It works 

Second solution:  
1.	Knowing I could call the script to run on the vps from my host. I decided to create the same script from my host. Scp the sh.file to the vps and execute it from my main script. It works 

Third solution: (it works in one script, so I went with this ) 
1.	Call out the case option before entering vps. 
2.	Once user has input the selection, store that variable. 
3.	Enter vps with said variable and run the script. Resulting, all being run on one whole script and echo and save result.

So here’s how I did it. 

 



 







That basically summarize all of the step. Put it all together and run. 



Running Result: script is running on kali. Result stored in txt in vps. 

 



Anonymous ssh result 

# Summary. 
# 1. establish your IP
# 2. start nipe
# 3. check if you are anonymous. 
# 4. echo your anonynmous IP and location
# 5. Run nmap/whois. 
# 6. echo the answer and save result

Prerequisites:

> *IMPORTANT* Make sure you have nipe installed before running the script
